# Dot-Dash-Decode
A MORSE code decoding project that takes eye blink as input and gives English text as output

###  Motivation behind the project
Communication is an important aspect for human beings. However, the individuals with severe motor disabilities often face significant challenges in expressing themselves. Traditional assistive technologies, such as speech-to-text software or physical keyboard, may not be always a viable solution for individuals with limited or no muscle control.

Also, during a television interview in 1966, Jeremiah Denton, a U.S. Navy Commander and POW in North Vietnam, blinked the word "T-O-R-T-U-R-E" in Morse code to alert the U.S. military to the mistreatment of American prisoners of war.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Understanding the Project





Now lets dive into the Technical part of the project

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Aspect

#### How is this tool supposed to work?

The user is supposed to start the tool and input the MORSE Code through his eyes so that means access to user's webcam is required. The camera inputs the frames that must be processed to detect blink and determine whether the blink a long blink or a short blink.
